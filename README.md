Findings

I analyzed the data for the full 2019 year.  Two specific trends were observed.  The highest usage period was 

during the summer months of August and September, with a ramp up in June and a decline starting in October.  The 

vast majority of users of the service were subscription holders. This points to an indication that residence 

instead of tourists are the primary user of the service. Aditionally Grove Station is the highest utilized of all 

the locations.
